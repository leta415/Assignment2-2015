Design Principles:
We followed three of the design principles that we learned in class in our assignment.
1) Constraints - By displaying the "log in with Instagram" button, and the instruction in the jumbotron telling the user to login with Instagram, we restricted possible actions that can be performed by the user. If users ever try to go to the other pages by typing in the URL without logging in, it will redirect users back to the signin page.

2) Mapping - In all of our subpages, we included the page titles in jumbotron and also a "Menu" button to go back to the main menu page, so that users can know where they are and where can they go in all our pages. 

3) Feedback - We added a loader spinner for an Ajax call while the call is in process in our subpages that require some time to load. The loading spinner provides user feedbacks that the chart is being loaded, and after the chart finishes with loading, the loader will disappear.
