Design Principles:
We followed three of the design principles that we learned in class in our assignment.

1) Constraints - By displaying a welcome page that has Instagram covered all over it, we hoped to restrict any other possible actions the user may have expected, such as logging into other social media sites or signing up for an account. To enforce further restrictions, if users ever try to go to the other pages by typing in the URL without logging in, it will redirect users back to the signin page.

2) Mapping - In all of our subpages, we have included a brand name that shows some movement when hovered, to easily show users that they can click on it, thus helping them quickly learn how to navigate throughout the app. 

3) Feedback - We added a loader spinner for an Ajax call while the call is in process in our subpages that require some time to load. The loading spinner provides user feedbacks that the chart is being loaded, and after the chart finishes with loading, the loader will disappear. We also added the opacity effect when users hover over an image button, so that they know the image button is clickable.
